# house-price-prediction-linear-regression
A project where I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. It involved collecting data on these features and their corresponding prices, then preprocessing it to handle missing values and scale the features appropriately. I selected relevant attributes and trained the model using techniques like ordinary least squares and gradient descent. After evaluating its performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared, I found that the model accurately estimates house prices, which could be really helpful for understanding property values in the housing market."
